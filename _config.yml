 Hello! I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. I am grateful to be advised by <a href="http://arnab.org"><u>Prof. Arnab Nandi</u></a>. I develop tools and algorithms for information extraction from, and controllable optimization & enrichment of multimodal data. An exhaustive list of my publications can be found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6FE__csAAAAJ&hl=en"><u>here</u></a>. <br/><br/> One of my current research foci is Visually Rich Documents (VRD). Find an annotated bibliography of interesting works on various tasks related to VRD that I regularly refer to <a href="https://github.com/sarkhelritesh/vrd_resource"><u>here</u></a>.

more_background: Before graduate school, I was a part of the <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=59"><u>CMATER Research Laboratory</u></a> at Jadavpur University, India, where I developed a cost-effective optical character recognition system for Indian languages. Read about some of our findings <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320316300437"><u>here</u></a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320317302200"><u>here</u></a>. Many moons ago, I used to be a part of a research and development group in Samsung Research Institute with a focus on increasing the accesibility of mobile devices. Read about some of the products I have worked on <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/accessibility/galaxy-mobile/?awc=18739_1604366004_d9043d50014c2c1c5b983b3d501e5333"><u>here</u></a>.<br/><br/> I have reviewed for journals including IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, Soft Computing (Springer), and Neurocomputing (Elsevier). I have also volunteered as an external reviewer for conferences including SIGMOD and The Web Conference.
